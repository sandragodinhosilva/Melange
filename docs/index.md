Genome annotation involves identifying open reading frames (ORFs) and comparing them with information from curated databases for functional annotation. However, there are challenges with the current methods used for genome annotation, such as limited customization and automation options in web portals, and requiring technical know-how for command-line interfaces (CLIs). To address these challenges, our solution is Melange, a user-friendly, customizable, and scalable CLI tool for genome annotation. Melange combines five databases, including Pfam, COG, KEGG, CAZyme, and MEROPS, to provide a more comprehensive and reliable functional annotation of proteins in a genome. The tool is suitable for small to large-scale genome annotation efforts can be used for various annotations needs.


### Citing Melange
At the moment, Melange does not have a publication describing its features (we are working on it). Please use a link to Melange Github when referring to this tool.
