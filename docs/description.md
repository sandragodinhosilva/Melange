# Melange Description

## The problem
 With the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, the amount of genomic data available far exceeds the amount of data that is thoroughly analysed. This can be partly explained by the difficulties of sorting and comparing large amounts of data, which is usually computationally intensive and often intractable. However, such large comparative genomics studies can be essential to determine important genomic or functional traits of different groups of organisms based on phylogeny, taxonomy, ecosystem origin, etc.

## Our solution
**Melange** aims to facilitate large-scale comparative genomic studies by combining different annotation schemes. Melange performs automatic, multi-parallel genome annotations using various databases such as Pfam, COG, Kegg, CAZYmes and MEROPS, and provides these annotations in a tabular format that can be used in further studies.
